# The October 2017 revision did the following to this file........................
# 1:  Removed the previous years model runs, the results of model runs from 2009-2015 are now stored in the folder ... \BoF\Model_results_2009_2015\.  This was
#     done because there was no consistent file structure before this time for how the model results were stored (if they were even retained).  Now all model results for these
#     years should be easily located.  From 2016 onwards the model results from the previous year are loaded from where they were saved last year
# 2:  Defined a set number of iterations for all the model MCMC runs stored above, niter was 100,000, nburnin was 50,000, nchains = 3, and nthin = 10.  For model year
#     2016 I left these values as whatever they were in 2016 as this model was run and I wanted to use those results for the prediction evaluation to be consistent.
# 3:  While niter and other MCMC parameters can be changed, unless the model structure changes I don't see any reason to use anything other than these values as the 
#     model appears to converge, but we do need to improve our convergence criteria for example we don't return Rhat values which is a good quick convergence criteria check.
# 4:  Made a SPA4.inits function below, this was more useful when running a bunch of different years, but works and there is no need to rename this each year.  If you
#     change the nchains you'll need to add/remove a row from this (you need 1 list(P=...) for each chain).
# 5:  Using variable NY rather than entering the number of years in all places required.
# 6:  Created/organized some very basic file structure for the results from this based on what we had in place.  
#     Each year we will need to create a folder structure .../'Year' Assement/'Area'....  This is where we should put everything related to at least the modelling for a given
#     area.  We can have a bigger discussion on what exactly should go where whenever we have time.  All model results are being place in a sub-folder called "ModelOutput"
#     So for 2017 the model script for SPA3 is found at Y:\INSHORE SCALLOP\BoF\2017\2017 Assessment\SPA3\SPA3_Model_2017_final.r
#     And the model results (figures, tables, Rdata files) are found inside Y:\INSHORE SCALLOP\BoF\2017\2017 Assessment\SPA3\ModelOutput
#     The larger discussion about file organization may alter this structure but until that happens please look at 2017 file structure to mimic this in subsequent years.
#  7: Options to save the figures and model results are embedded in the code, they are commented out by default so you don't overwrite something by mistake, uncomment these
#     to save.
#  8: The old model run files + an intermediary file I used to transition from old way to this way can be found in the "archive" folder found in each areas Assessment folder
#  9:  Thanks for Freya we now have a function (BoF.model.stats) which produces a nice summary of the model results

# In May/Aug 2018 while doing somethng completely different DK decided to:
# 1:  Remove the ooogly stript which had us inputing data manually 
# 2:  Note that you'll need to manually update the file SPA3_ModelData.xlsx each year.
# In September 2018 the prediction evaluation was overhauled and automated, manual entries are now minimized in this script to the
# as great an extent as possible, I believe you will only need to update catch.next.year in the script.

###  J.Sameoto June 2020  Modified for running 2019 model run in Summer 2020 and for new folder structure of BOF 
### J.Sameoto June 2021 modified to define LRP, USR up front, to calculate probabiltiy > USR and > LRP for current year commercial biomass, and save out select result and diagnostics to be used by future Rmd CSAS Update file, make model file name generic so don't update every year,

## ---- Build and check the model input file ----

# Steps:
# 1) run the function below with savefile=F
# 2) review the messages in the R console
# 3) review CompareOutputTable_SPAxx.xlsx
# 4) Highlight any problematic values in yellow, and re-save as CompareOutputTable_SPAxx_highlighted.xlsx
# 5) Add manual edits to CreateExcelModelFile_2020.R as needed, in the EDITS section (~line 345). Keep it organized by SPA!
# 6) Review the diagnostics in the Plots and Viewer tabs of Rstudio
# 7) run the function below with savefile=T
# 8) colour code the notes as needed
# 9) when satisfied with the table, re-name it to remove the date. E.g. SPAxx_ModelData_R.xlsx
